    Hi Magnus,

    I'm just going through the source code and assets to check licensing.

    Can you confirm that you're willing to license your contributions
    under the GPL 2.0? You'll still hold the copyright on your
    contributions.

    You can read the full text of the license here:
    https://github.com/TheJosh/chaotic-rage/blob/master/LICENSE

    If you are happy with that, can you please reply via an email stating
    that fact, something like this:

        All of my past & future contributions to Chaotic Rage may
        be licensed under the GPLv2 license.

    Thank you for all of your contributions!

    Cheers,
    Josh

    Hi Josh,
    I thought the licence was already GPL 2.0, so I have no problem with the
    licence.

    To clarify:

    All of my past and future contributions to Chaotic Rage may be licensed
    under the GPLv2 license.

    BRs
    Magnus
