    Hi Mats,

    Many years ago, you produced a few songs for a game I'm working on
    called "Chaotic Rage".

    The songs are:
    - An Introduction to Pain
    - High Speed Kill Greed
    - Pump Action Interaction

    I just wanted to confirm that you are okay if I distribute those songs
    as part of the game, and licensed under a GPLv2 license. You would
    still retain the copyright.

    If this is the case, can you please reply to this effect.

    Cheers,
    Josh
