    Hi Psionic,

    I'm currently using some of your free models in a game that I've been
    working on for a few years now. Thank you for them!

    I'm emailing you because the wording on your website doesn't agree
    with the wording in the README files which are distributed with the
    models. This is a bit of an issue because my game is open source, and
    I'm trying to get it into the Debian archive. and they are really
    fussy with licensing and copyright attribution.

    Thus, can you confirm that the models are definitely free - i.e.
    public domain or creative commons zero.

    Regards,
    Josh
