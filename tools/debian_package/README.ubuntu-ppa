Install necessary packages
	> sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts ubuntu-dev-tools \
	debhelper dh-make patch cdbs quilt gnupg fakeroot lintian pbuilder piuparts


Set up gpg-key and ssh-key to be able to sign the package
	Create a launchpad account
	https://launchpad.net

	Setup your gpg-key & ssh-key
	https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey
	https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/CreatingAnSSHKeyPair

	Set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME (optional - add these to '~/.bashrc')
	(must be the same as the gpg key (command: 'gpg --list-keys'))
		> export DEBEMAIL=<email address>
		> export DEBFULLNAME="Full Name"


Clone the git repo
	> git clone git@github.com:TheJosh/chaotic-rage.git
	> cd chaotic-rage


Prepare for building the package
	Increment the changelog with the Debian release number (edit with 'dch --edit')
	> dch --changelog=tools/debian_package/ubuntu/changelog --increment
	Note: Update the target (Ubuntu version) to e.g. 'trusty'.


Build package (optional for PPA upload)
	> make deb-ubuntu
	The Debian package is now ready to be installed


Build for Personal Package Archive (PPA)
	Create brand new package since no existing version in Ubuntu's repositories
	> make deb-ubuntu-ppa


Test building locally
	pbuilder allows you to build packages locally on your machine. The build
	will be done in a minimal and clean environment. And possible to set up
	multiple instances for various Ubuntu and Debian releases.

	Set up pbuilder (only needed once per release)
	> pbuilder-dist <release> create
	Build a test package
	> pbuilder-dist <release> build <package>_<version>.dsc


Upload to the Chaotic Rage PPA
	> dput ppa:chaotic-rage/chaoticrage <source.changes>
