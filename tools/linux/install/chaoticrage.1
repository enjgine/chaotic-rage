.SH DESCRIPTION
Chaotic rage is a silly little 3D shooter game which uses OpenGL.
.SH OPTIONS
\-\-arcade      Start an arcade game for a specific map, gametype and unit name.

              Argument should be comma\-separated;
                 MAP     The map name to play on
                 GAME    The name of the gametype to play
                 UNIT    The name of the unit to play
              
\-\-host        When starting an arcade game, also host a network server.
              
\-\-campaign    Start a single\-player campaign. Takes a single argument, the name of the campaign to play.

\-\-join        Join a network game. Takes a single argument, the IP address of the server to join.

If no specific startup mode is specified, the game loads a menu screen.


\-\-render      Specify the video subsystem. Options: 'opengl', 'debug', 'null'.

\-\-window      Run the game in windowed mode (optionally at a specific width and height).

\-\-fullscreen  Run the game in fullscreen mode.

\-\-audio       Specify the audio subsystem. Options: 'sdl', 'null'.

\-\-mod         Load an additional mod.

\-\-mod\-list    Show a list of mods, and exit.

\-\-throttle    Add a delay loop to run the game at lower CPU.
              Normally not required because the GPU throttles the play rate, but very useful on dedicated servers.
              
\-\-help        Show help, and exit.

\-\-version     Show version information, and exit.
